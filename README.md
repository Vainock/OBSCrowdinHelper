This program is used to gather translators from the official [OBS Studio Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/obs-studio) and to put them in the end into the [AUTHORS file](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/blob/master/AUTHORS) in the [OBS Studio GitHub repository](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio). It will be used by a OBS Studio contributor on each translation update.

The newest build can be found on the Releases page.

The reason why you have to login with a Crowdin account is, that the [Reports page](https://crowdin.com/project/obs-studio/reports) where all the datas are visible can only be viewed as a logged in user.
